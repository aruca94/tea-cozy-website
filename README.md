## Project Description

This project is an "off-platform" project in the Codecademy Front-End Engineer Career Path. It uses HTML and CSS to produce this nice looking static landing page of a tea shop named Tea Cozy. It has a fixed header four sections and is styled with flexbox and css grid.

The template for the project can be found in the Credits section.

This project was not a guided project. All that was provided was a link to a pfd style page that has a sample of what the finished website should look like and you are required to produce the website only using help from google, stackoverflow, etc.

## Personal Comments on project

This project was very enjoyable to work on. This project being early in the Front-End Engineer career path on Codecademy uses basic html and css fundementals such as float, clear, and various other positioning concepts. Having some exposure to flexbox and css grid I decided to use this as it would not only give myself the opportunity to learn more about grid and flexbox, but I could learn it at the same time as I work on a project.


Responsive design has not been covered yet so it is not required for this project. I haven't implemented it yet but in preperation for responsive design I chose to use % and rem values to make it a little easier on me when I do update it.

## Future Implements

Future implements will include things such as responsive design, better accessibility, JavaScript for interactions, and potentially a multipage website with breadcrumb navigation.
